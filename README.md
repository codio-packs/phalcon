#Phalcon (2.0.0)


## Using the Pack
To use the Pack, we created 2 menu options, which you can find on the right of the menu. These menus can be configured in the `.codio` file.

1. **Start Server** : When you come into your Project, start the internal PHP server.
1. **Preview** : This previews your app. 

**Note:** Do not set the 'Inside Codio' option.

If you prefer to start the internal PHP server yourself, you can do so in the terminal (Tools>Terminal) entering:
```
php -S 0.0.0.0:3000 -t ~/workspace/projects/phalcon/tutorial/public/
```
 
## Accessing the application
To access your application from a browser, you can use the menu option described above. The url of your Phalcon project can be found in the `Project->Box Info` menu and will look something like this

```
https://vital-ego.box.codio.io:9500/
```

and you should see
```
"...Hello!...
Sign Up Here!..."
```


##How the Pack was prepared
This Starter Pack was built on the `Phalcon` Codio Certified Stack.
